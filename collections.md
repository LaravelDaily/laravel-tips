### Use groupBy on Collections with Custom Callback Function

If you want to group result by some condition which isn’t a direct column in your database, you can do that by providing a closure function.

For example, if you want to group users by day of registration, here’s the code:

```php
$users = User::all()->groupBy(function($item) {
    return $item->created_at->format('Y-m-d');
});
```

⚠️ Notice: it is done on a `Collection` class, so performed **AFTER** the results are fetched from the database.

### Laravel Scopes can be combined using "Higher Order" orWhere Method

Following example from the Docs.

Before:
```php
User::popular()->orWhere(function (Builder $query) {
     $query->active();
})->get()
```

After:
```php
User::popular()->orWhere->active()->get();
```

### Multiple Collection Methods in a Row

If you query all results with `->all()` or `->get()`, you may then perform various Collection operations on the same result, it won’t query database every time.

```php
$users = User::all();
echo 'Max ID: ' . $users->max('id');
echo 'Average age: ' . $users->avg('age');
echo 'Total budget: ' . $users->sum('budget');
```

### Calculate Sum with Pagination

How to calculate the sum of all records when you have only the PAGINATED collection? Do the calculation BEFORE the pagination, but from the same query.

```php
// How to get sum of post_views with pagination?
$posts = Post::paginate(10);
// This will be only for page 1, not ALL posts
$sum = $posts->sum('post_views');

// Do this with Query Builder
$query = Post::query();
// Calculate sum
$sum = $query->sum('post_views');
// And then do the pagination from the same query
$posts = $query->paginate(10);
```

### Serial no in foreach loop with pagination

We can use foreach collection items index as serial no (SL) in pagination.

```php
   ...
   <th>Serial</th>
    ...
    @foreach ($products as $product)
    <tr>
        <td>{{ $loop->index + $product->firstItem() }}</td>
        ...
    @endforeach
```

it will solve the issue of next pages(?page=2&...) index count from continue.

### Higher order collection methods

Collections have higher order methods, this are methods that can be chained , like `groupBy()` , `map()` ... Giving you a fluid syntax. This example calculates the
price per group of products on an offer.

```php
$offer = [
        'name'  => 'offer1',
        'lines' => [
            ['group' => 1, 'price' => 10],
            ['group' => 1, 'price' => 20],
            ['group' => 2, 'price' => 30],
            ['group' => 2, 'price' => 40],
            ['group' => 3, 'price' => 50],
            ['group' => 3, 'price' => 60]
        ]
];

$totalPerGroup = collect($offer['lines'])->groupBy('group')->map(fn($group) => $group->sum('price'));
```

### Higher order collection message

Collections also provide support for "higher order messages", which are short-cuts for performing common actions on collections.
This example calculates the price per group of products on an offer.

```php
$offer = [
        'name'  => 'offer1',
        'lines' => [
            ['group' => 1, 'price' => 10],
            ['group' => 1, 'price' => 20],
            ['group' => 2, 'price' => 30],
            ['group' => 2, 'price' => 40],
            ['group' => 3, 'price' => 50],
            ['group' => 3, 'price' => 60]
        ]
];

$totalPerGroup = collect($offer['lines'])->groupBy->group->map->sum('price');
```

### Get an existing key or insert a value if it doesn't exist and return the value

In Laravel 8.81 `getOrPut` method to Collections that simplifies the use-case where you want to either get an existing key or insert a value if it doesn't exist and return the value.

```php
$key = 'name';
// Still valid
if ($this->collection->has($key) === false) {
    $this->collection->put($key, ...);
}

return $this->collection->get($key);

// Using the `getOrPut()` method with closure
return $this->collection->getOrPut($key, fn() => ...);

// Or pass a fixed value
return $this->collection->getOrPut($key, $value='teacoders');
```

### Static times method

The static times method creates a new collection by invoking the given closure a specified number of times.

```php
Collection::times(7, function ($number) {
    return now()->addDays($number)->format('d-m-Y');
});
// Output: [01-04-2022, 02-04-2022, ..., 07-04-2022]
```

### Collection Paginate

Since laravel 9, you can create your own paginate.

```php
use Illuminate\Pagination\LengthAwarePaginator;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

public static function collectionPaginate(Collection $collection, int $perPage, int $currentPage): LengthAwarePaginator
{
    $perPage = max($perPage, 1);
    $totalPages = ceil($collection->count() / $perPage);
    $currentPage = min($totalPages, max($currentPage, 1));

    $skip = ($currentPage - 1) * $perPage;
    $take = min($collection->count(), $perPage);

    $collection = $collection->skip($skip)
        ->take($take)
        ->values();
    return new LengthAwarePaginator($collection, $totalPages, $perPage);
}
```
Example:
```php
collectionPaginate(collect([...]), 12, 1);
```
