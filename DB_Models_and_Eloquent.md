### Reuse or clone query()

Typically, we need to query multiple time from a filtered query. So, most of the time we use `query()` method,

let's write a query for getting today created active and inactive products

```php

$query = Product::query();


$today = request()->q_date ?? today();
if($today){
    $query->where('created_at', $today);
}

// lets get active and inactive products
$active_products = $query->where('status', 1)->get(); // this line modified the $query object variable
$inactive_products = $query->where('status', 0)->get(); // so here we will not find any inactive products
```

But, after getting `$active products` the` $query `will be modified. So, `$inactive_products` will not find any inactive products from `$query`  and that will return blank collection every time. Cause, that will try to find inactive products from `$active_products` (`$query` will return active products only).

For solve this issue, we can query multiple time by reusing this `$query` object.
So, We need to clone this `$query` before doing any `$query` modification action.

```php
$active_products = $query->clone()->where('status', 1)->get(); // it will not modify the $query
$inactive_products = $query->clone()->where('status', 0)->get(); // so we will get inactive products from $query

```

### Eloquent where date methods

In Eloquent, check the date with functions `whereDay()`, `whereMonth()`, `whereYear()`, `whereDate()` and `whereTime()`.

```php
$products = Product::whereDate('created_at', '2018-01-31')->get();
$products = Product::whereMonth('created_at', '12')->get();
$products = Product::whereDay('created_at', '31')->get();
$products = Product::whereYear('created_at', date('Y'))->get();
$products = Product::whereTime('created_at', '=', '14:13:58')->get();
```

### Increments and decrements

If you want to increment some DB column in some table, just use `increment()` function. Oh, and you can increment not only by 1, but also by some number, like 50.

```php
Post::find($post_id)->increment('view_count');
User::find($user_id)->increment('points', 50);
```

### No timestamp columns

If your DB table doesn't contain timestamp fields `created_at` and `updated_at`, you can specify that Eloquent model wouldn't use them, with `$timestamps = false` property.

```php
class Company extends Model
{
    public $timestamps = false;
}
```

### Soft-deletes: multiple restore

When using soft-deletes, you can restore multiple rows in one sentence.

```php
Post::onlyTrashed()->where('author_id', 1)->restore();
```

### Model all: columns

When calling Eloquent's `Model::all()`, you can specify which columns to return.

```php
$users = User::all(['id', 'name', 'email']);
```

### To Fail or not to Fail

In addition to `findOrFail()`, there's also Eloquent method `firstOrFail()` which will return 404 page if no records for query are found.

```php
$user = User::where('email', 'povilas@laraveldaily.com')->firstOrFail();
```

### Column name change

In Eloquent Query Builder, you can specify "as" to return any column with a different name, just like in plain SQL query.

```php
$users = DB::table('users')->select('name', 'email as user_email')->get();
```

### Map query results

After Eloquent query you can modify rows by using `map()` function in Collections.

```php
$users = User::where('role_id', 1)->get()->map(function (User $user) {
    $user->some_column = some_function($user);
    return $user;
});
```

### Change Default Timestamp Fields

What if you’re working with non-Laravel database and your timestamp columns are named differently? Maybe, you have create_time and update_time. Luckily, you can specify them in the model, too:

```php
class Role extends Model
{
    const CREATED_AT = 'create_time';
    const UPDATED_AT = 'update_time';
}
```

### Quick Order by created_at

Instead of:
```php
User::orderBy('created_at', 'desc')->get();
```

You can do it quicker:
```php
User::latest()->get();
```

By default, `latest()` will order by `created_at`.

There is an opposite method `oldest()` which would order by `created_at` ascending:
```php
User::oldest()->get();
```

Also, you can specify another column to order by. For example, if you want to use `updated_at`, you can do this:
```php
$lastUpdatedUser = User::latest('updated_at')->first();
```

### Automatic Column Value When Creating Records

If you want to generate some DB column value when creating record, add it to model's `boot()` method.
For example, if you have a field "position" and want to assign the next available position to the new record (like `Country::max('position') + 1)`, do this:

```php
class Country extends Model {
    protected static function boot()
    {
        parent::boot();

        Country::creating(function($model) {
            $model->position = Country::max('position') + 1;
        });
    }
}
```

### DB Raw Query Calculations Run Faster

Use SQL raw queries like `whereRaw()` method, to make some DB-specific calculations directly in query, and not in Laravel, usually the result will be faster. Like, if you want to get users that were active 30+ days after their registration, here's the code:

```php
User::where('active', 1)
    ->whereRaw('TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, created_at, updated_at) > ?', 30)
    ->get();
```

### More than One Scope

You can combine and chain Query Scopes in Eloquent, using more than one scope in a query.

Model:
```php
public function scopeActive($query) {
    return $query->where('active', 1);
}

public function scopeRegisteredWithinDays($query, $days) {
    return $query->where('created_at', '>=', now()->subDays($days));
}
```

Some Controller:
```php
$users = User::registeredWithinDays(30)->active()->get();
```

### No Need to Convert Carbon

If you're performing `whereDate()` and check today's records, you can use Carbon's `now()` and it will automatically be transformed to date. No need to do `->toDateString()`.

```php
// Instead of
$todayUsers = User::whereDate('created_at', now()->toDateString())->get();
// No need to convert, just use now()
$todayUsers = User::whereDate('created_at', now())->get();
```

### Grouping by First Letter

You can group Eloquent results by any custom condition, here's how to group by first letter of user's name:
```php
$users = User::all()->groupBy(function($item) {
    return $item->name[0];
});
```

### Never Update the Column

If you have DB column which you want to be set only once and never updated again, you can set that restriction on Eloquent Model, with a mutator:

- In version 9 and above:
```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\Attribute;

class User extends Model
{
    protected function email(): Attribute
    {
        return Attribute::make(
            set: fn ($value, $attributes) => $attributes['email'] ?? $value,
        );
    }
}
```
- In version 9 and below:
```php
class User extends Model
{
    public function setEmailAttribute($value)
    {
        if (isset($this->attributes['email']) && ! is_null($this->attributes['email'])) {
            return;
        }
        $this->attributes['email'] = $value;
    }
}
```

### Find Many

Eloquent method `find()` may accept multiple parameters, and then it returns a Collection of all records found, not just one Model:
```php
// Will return Eloquent Model
$user = User::find(1);
// Will return Eloquent Collection
$users = User::find([1,2,3]);
```
```php
return Product::whereIn('id', $this->productIDs)->get();
// You can do this
return Product::find($this->productIDs)
```

Tip given by [@tahiriqbalnajam](https://twitter.com/tahiriqbalnajam/status/1436120403655671817)

Incase of integer, use `whereIn` with limited data range only instead use `whereIntegerInRaw` which is faster then `whereIn`.

```php
Product::whereIn('id', range(1, 50))->get();
// You can do this
Product::whereIntegerInRaw('id', range(1, 50))->get();
```

Tip given by [@sachinkiranti](https://raisachin.com.np)

### Find Many and return specific columns

Eloquent method `find()` may accept multiple parameters, and then it returns a Collection of all records found with specificied columns, not all columns of model:
```php
// Will return Eloquent Model with first_name and email only
$user = User::find(1, ['first_name', 'email']);
// Will return Eloquent Collection with first_name and email only
$users = User::find([1,2,3], ['first_name', 'email']);
```
Tip given by [@tahiriqbalnajam](https://github.com/tahiriqbalnajam)

### Find by Key

You can also find multiple records with `whereKey()` method which takes care of which field is exactly your primary key (`id` is the default but you may override it in Eloquent model):

```php
$users = User::whereKey([1,2,3])->get();
```

### Use UUID instead of auto-increment

You don't want to use auto incrementing ID in your model?

Migration:
```php
Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    // $table->increments('id');
    $table->uuid('id')->unique();
});
```

### Laravel 9 and above:
```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Concerns\HasUuids;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
 
class Article extends Model
{
    use HasUuids;
 
    // ...
}
 
$article = Article::create(['title' => 'Traveling to Europe']);
 
$article->id; // "8f8e8478-9035-4d23-b9a7-62f4d2612ce5"
```
#### Laravel 8 and below:
Model:
* In PHP 7.4.0 and above:
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    public $incrementing = false;
    protected $keyType = 'string';

    protected static function boot()
    {
        parent::boot();

        self::creating(fn (User $model) => $model->attributes['id'] = Str::uuid());
        self::saving(fn (User $model) => $model->attributes['id'] = Str::uuid());
    }
}
```

* In PHP older than 7.4.0:
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    public $incrementing = false;
    protected $keyType = 'string';

    protected static function boot()
    {
        parent::boot();

        self::creating(function ($model) {
             $model->attributes['id'] = Str::uuid();
        });
        self::saving(function ($model) {
             $model->attributes['id'] = Str::uuid();
        });
    }
}
```

### Sub-selects in Laravel Way

From Laravel 6, you can use addSelect() in Eloquent statement, and do some calculation to that added column.

```php
return Destination::addSelect(['last_flight' => Flight::select('name')
    ->whereColumn('destination_id', 'destinations.id')
    ->orderBy('arrived_at', 'desc')
    ->limit(1)
])->get();
```

### Hide Some Columns

When doing Eloquent query, if you want to hide specific field from being returned, one of the quickest ways is to add `->makeHidden()` on Collection result.

```php
$users = User::all()->makeHidden(['email_verified_at', 'deleted_at']);
```

### Exact DB Error

If you want to catch Eloquent Query exceptions, use specific `QueryException` instead default Exception class, and you will be able to get the exact SQL code of the error.

```php
try {
    // Some Eloquent/SQL statement
} catch (\Illuminate\Database\QueryException $e) {
    if ($e->getCode() === '23000') { // integrity constraint violation
        return back()->withError('Invalid data');
    }
}
```

### Soft-Deletes with Query Builder

Don't forget that soft-deletes will exclude entries when you use Eloquent, but won't work if you use Query Builder.

```php
// Will exclude soft-deleted entries
$users = User::all();

// Will NOT exclude soft-deleted entries
$users = User::withTrashed()->get();

// Will NOT exclude soft-deleted entries
$users = DB::table('users')->get();
```

### Good Old SQL Query

If you need to execute a simple SQL query, without getting any results - like changing something in DB schema, you can just do `DB::statement()`.

```php
DB::statement('DROP TABLE users');
DB::statement('ALTER TABLE projects AUTO_INCREMENT=123');
```

### Use DB Transactions

If you have two DB operations performed, and second may get an error, then you should rollback the first one, right?

For that, I suggest to use DB Transactions, it's really easy in Laravel:

```php
DB::transaction(function () {
    DB::table('users')->update(['votes' => 1]);

    DB::table('posts')->delete();
});
```

### Update or Create

If you need to check if the record exists, and then update it, or create a new record otherwise, you can do it in one sentence - use Eloquent method `updateOrCreate()`:

```php
// Instead of this
$flight = Flight::where('departure', 'Oakland')
    ->where('destination', 'San Diego')
    ->first();
if ($flight) {
    $flight->update(['price' => 99, 'discounted' => 1]);
} else {
	$flight = Flight::create([
	    'departure' => 'Oakland',
	    'destination' => 'San Diego',
	    'price' => 99,
	    'discounted' => 1
	]);
}
// Do it in ONE sentence
$flight = Flight::updateOrCreate(
    ['departure' => 'Oakland', 'destination' => 'San Diego'],
    ['price' => 99, 'discounted' => 1]
);
```

### Forget Cache on Save

Tip given by [@pratiksh404](https://github.com/pratiksh404)

If you have cache key like `posts` that gives collection, and you want to forget that cache key on new store or update, you can call static `saved` function on your model:

```php
class Post extends Model
{
    // Forget cache key on storing or updating
    public static function boot()
    {
        parent::boot();
        static::saved(function () {
           Cache::forget('posts');
        });
    }
}
```

### Change Format Of Created_at and Updated_at

Tip given by [@syofyanzuhad](https://github.com/syofyanzuhad)

To change the format of `created_at` you can add a method in your model like this:
```php
public function getCreatedAtFormattedAttribute()
{
   return $this->created_at->format('H:i d, M Y');
}
```
So you can use it `$entry->created_at_formatted` when it's needed.
It will return the `created_at` attribute like this: `04:19 23, Aug 2020`.

And also for changing format of `updated_at` attribute, you can add this method :
```php
public function getUpdatedAtFormattedAttribute()
{
   return $this->updated_at->format('H:i d, M Y');
}
```
So you can use it `$entry->updated_at_formatted` when it's needed.
It will return the `updated_at` attribute like this: `04:19 23, Aug 2020`.

### Storing Array Type into JSON

Tip given by [@pratiksh404](https://github.com/pratiksh404)

If you have input field which takes an array and you have to store it as a JSON, you can use `$casts` property in your model. Here `images` is a JSON attribute.

```php
protected $casts = [
    'images' => 'array',
];
```

So you can store it as a JSON, but when retrieved from DB, it can be used as an array.

### Make a Copy of the Model

If you have two very similar Models (like shipping address and billing address) and you need to make a copy of one to another, you can use `replicate()` method and change some properties after that.

Example from the [official docs](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent#replicating-models):

```php
$shipping = Address::create([
    'type' => 'shipping',
    'line_1' => '123 Example Street',
    'city' => 'Victorville',
    'state' => 'CA',
    'postcode' => '90001',
]);

$billing = $shipping->replicate()->fill([
    'type' => 'billing'
]);

$billing->save();
```

### Reduce Memory

Sometimes we need to load a huge amount of data into memory. For example:
```php
$orders = Order::all();
```
But this can be slow if we have really huge data, because Laravel prepares objects of the Model class.
In such cases, Laravel has a handy function `toBase()`

```php
$orders = Order::toBase()->get();
//$orders will contain `Illuminate\Support\Collection` with objects `StdClass`.
```
By calling this method, it will fetch the data from the database, but it will not prepare the Model class.
Keep in mind it is often a good idea to pass an array of fields to the get method, preventing all fields to be fetched from the database.

### Force query without $fillable/$guarded
If you create a Laravel boilerplate as a "starter" for other devs, and you're not in control of what THEY would later fill in Model's $fillable/$guarded, you may use forceFill()
```php
$team->update(['name' => $request->name])
```
What if "name" is not in Team model's `$fillable`? Or what if there's no `$fillable/$guarded` at all?
```php
$team->forceFill(['name' => $request->name])
```
This will "ignore" the `$fillable` for that one query and will execute no matter what.

### 3-level structure of parent-children
If you have a 3-level structure of parent-children, like categories in an e-shop, and you want to show the number of products on the third level, you can use `with('yyy.yyy')` and then add `withCount()` as a condition
```php
class HomeController extend Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $categories = Category::query()
            ->whereNull('category_id')
            ->with(['subcategories.subcategories' => function($query) {
                $query->withCount('products');
            }])->get();
    }
}
```
```php
class Category extends Model
{
    public function subcategories()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Category::class);
    }
    
    public function products()
    {
    return $this->hasMany(Product::class);
    }
}
```
```php
<ul>
    @foreach($categories as $category)
        <li>
            {{ $category->name }}
            @if ($category->subcategories)
                <ul>
                @foreach($category->subcategories as $subcategory)
                    <li>
                        {{ $subcategory->name }}
                        @if ($subcategory->subcategories)
                            <ul>
                                @foreach ($subcategory->subcategories as $subcategory)
                                    <li>{{ $subcategory->name }} ({{ $subcategory->product_count }})</li>
                                @endforeach
                            </ul>
                        @endif
                    </li>
                @endforeach
                </ul>
            @endif
        </li>
    @endforeach           
</ul>
```

### Perform any action on failure
When looking for a record, you may want to perform some actions if it's not found.
In addition to `->firstOrFail()` which just throws 404, you can perform any action on failure, just do `->firstOr(function() { ... })`
```php
$model = Flight::where('legs', '>', 3)->firstOr(function () {
    // ...
})
```

### Check if record exists or show 404
Don't use find() and then check if the record exists. Use findOrFail().
```php
$product = Product::find($id);
if (!$product) {
    abort(404);
}
$product->update($productDataArray);
```
Shorter way
```php
$product = Product::findOrFail($id); // shows 404 if not found
$product->update($productDataArray);
```

### Abort if condition failed
`abort_if()` can be used as shorter way to check condition and throw an error page.
```php
$product = Product::findOrFail($id);
if($product->user_id != auth()->user()->id){
    abort(403);
}
```
Shorter way
```php
/* abort_if(CONDITION, ERROR_CODE) */
$product = Product::findOrFail($id);
abort_if ($product->user_id != auth()->user()->id, 403)
```

### Fill a column automatically while you persist data to the database
If you want to fill a column automatically while you persist data to the database (e.g: slug) use Model Observer instead of hard code it every time
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

class Article extends Model
{
    ...
    protected static function boot()
    {
        parent:boot();
        
        static::saving(function ($model) {
            $model->slug = Str::slug($model->title);
        });
    }
}
```

### Extra information about the query
You can call the `explain()` method on queries to know extra information about the query.
```php
Book::where('name', 'Ruskin Bond')->explain()->dd();
```

```php
Illuminate\Support\Collection {#5344
    all: [
        {#15407
            +"id": 1,
            +"select_type": "SIMPLE",
            +"table": "books",
            +"partitions": null,
            +"type": "ALL",
            +"possible_keys": null,
            +"key": null,
            +"key_len": null,
            +"ref": null,
            +"rows": 9,
            +"filtered": 11.11111164093,
            +"Extra": "Using where",
        },
    ],
}
```

### Using the doesntExist() method in Laravel
```php
// This works
if ( 0 === $model->where('status', 'pending')->count() ) {
}

// But since I don't care about the count, just that there isn't one
// Laravel's exists() method is cleaner.
if ( ! $model->where('status', 'pending')->exists() ) {
}

// But I find the ! in the statement above easily missed. The
// doesntExist() method makes this statement even clearer.
if ( $model->where('status', 'pending')->doesntExist() ) {
}
```

### Trait that you want to add to a few Models to call their boot() method automatically
If you have a Trait that you want to add to a few Models to call their `boot()` method automatically, you can call Trait's method as boot[TraitName]
```php
class Transaction extends  Model
{
    use MultiTenantModelTrait;
}
```

```php
class Task extends  Model
{
    use MultiTenantModelTrait;
}
```

```php
trait MultiTenantModelTrait
{
    // This method's name is boot[TraitName]
    // It will be auto-called as boot() of Transaction/Task
    public static function bootMultiTenantModelTrait()
    {
        static::creating(function ($model) {
            if (!$isAdmin) {
                $isAdmin->created_by_id = auth()->id();
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### There are two common ways of determining if a table is empty in Laravel
There are two common ways of determining if a table is empty in Laravel. Calling `exists()` or `count()` directly on the model!<br>
One returns a strict true/false boolean, the other returns an integer which you can use as a falsy in conditionals.
```php
public function index()
{
    if (\App\Models\User::exists()) {
        // returns boolean true or false if the table has any saved rows
    }
    
    if (\App\Models\User::count()) {
        // returns the count of rows in the table
    }
}
```

### How to prevent “property of non-object” error
```php
// BelongsTo Default Models
// Let's say you have Post belonging to Author and then Blade code:
$post->author->name;

// Of course, you can prevent it like this:
$post->author->name ?? ''
// or
@$post->author->name

// But you can do it on Eloquent relationship level:
// this relation will return an empty App\Author model if no author is attached to the post
public function author() {
    return $this->belongsTo('App\Author')->withDefault();
}
// or
public function author() {
    return $this->belongsTo('App\Author')->withDefault([
        'name' => 'Guest Author'
    ]);
}
```

$user->name; // John
$user->name = "Peter"; // Peter
$user->getOriginal('name'); // John
$user->getOriginal(); // Original $user record
```

    ->get();
```

### Belongs to Many Pivot table naming

To determine the table name of the relationship's intermediate table, Eloquent will join the two related model names in alphabetical order. 

This would mean a join between `Post` and `Tag` could be added like this:

```php
class Post extends Model
{
    public $table = 'posts';

    public function tags()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Tag::class);
    }
}
```
However, you are free to override this convention, and you would need to specify the join table in the second argument.

```php
class Post extends Model
{
    public $table = 'posts';

    public function tags()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Tag::class, 'posts_tags');
    }
}
```
If you wish to be explicit about the primary keys you can also supply these as third and fourth arguments.
```php
class Post extends Model
{
    public $table = 'posts';

    public function tags()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Tag::class, 'post_tag', 'post_id', 'tag_id');
    }
}
```

### Order by Pivot Fields
`BelongsToMany::orderByPivot()` allows you to directly sort the results of a BelongsToMany relationship query.
```php
class Tag extends Model
{
    public $table = 'tags';
}

class Post extends Model
{
    public $table = 'posts';

    public function tags()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Tag::class, 'post_tag', 'post_id', 'tag_id')
            ->using(PostTagPivot::class)
            ->withTimestamps()
            ->withPivot('flag');
    }
}

class PostTagPivot extends Pivot
{
    protected $table = 'post_tag';
}

// Somewhere in the Controller
public function getPostTags($id)
{
    return Post::findOrFail($id)->tags()->orderByPivot('flag', 'desc')->get();
}
```

### Find a single record from a database
The `sole()` method will return only one record that matches the criteria. If no such entry is found, then a `NoRecordsFoundException` will be thrown. If multiple records are found, then a `MultipleRecordsFoundException` will be thrown.
```php
DB::table('products')->where('ref', '#123')->sole();
```

### Automatic records chunking
Similar to `each()` method, but easier to use. Automatically splits the result into parts (chunks).
```php
return User::orderBy('name')->chunkMap(fn ($user) => [
    'id' => $user->id,
    'name' => $user->name,
]), 25);
```

### Updating the model without dispatching events
Sometimes you need to update the model without sending any events. We can now do this with the `updateQuietly()` method, which under the hood uses the `saveQuietly()` method.
```php
$flight->updateQuietly(['departed' => false]);
```

### Periodic cleaning of models from obsolete records
To periodically clean models of obsolete records. With this trait, Laravel will do this automatically, only you need to adjust the frequency of the `model:prune` command in the Kernel class.
```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Prunable;
class Flight extends Model
{
    use Prunable;
    /**
     * Get the prunable model query.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder
     */
    public function prunable()
    {
        return static::where('created_at', '<=', now()->subMonth());
    }
}
```
Also, in the pruning method, you can set the actions that must be performed before deleting the model:
```php
protected function pruning()
{
    // Removing additional resources,
    // associated with the model. For example, files.

    Storage::disk('s3')->delete($this->filename);
}
```

### Immutable dates and casting to them
Laravel 8.53 introduces the `immutable_date` and `immutable_datetime` castes that convert dates to `Immutable`.

Cast to CarbonImmutable instead of a regular Carbon instance.
```php
class User extends Model
{
    public $casts = [
        'date_field'     => 'immutable_date',
        'datetime_field' => 'immutable_datetime',
    ];
}
```

### The findOrFail method also accepts a list of ids
The findOrFail method also accepts a list of ids. If any of these ids are not found, then it "fails".<br>
Nice if you need to retrieve a specific set of models and don't want to have to check that the count you got was the count you expected

```php
User::create(['id' => 1]);
User::create(['id' => 2);
User::create(['id' => 3]);

// Retrives the user...
$user = User::findOrFail(1);

// Throws a 404 because the user doesn't exist...
User::findOrFail(99);

// Retrives all 3 users...
$users = User::findOrFail([1, 2, 3]);

// Throws because it is unable to find *all* of the users
User::findOrFail([1, 2, 3, 99]);
```

### Prunable trait to automatically remove models from your database
New in Laravel 8.50: You can use the Prunable trait to automatically remove models from your database. For example, you can permanently remove soft deleted models after a few days.

```php
class File extends Model
{
    use SoftDeletes;
    
    // Add Prunable trait
    use Prunable;
    
    public function prunable()
    {
        // Files matching this query will be pruned
        return static::query()->where('deleted_at', '<=', now()->subDays(14));
    }
    
    protected function pruning()
    {
        // Remove the file from s3 before deleting the model
        Storage::disk('s3')->delete($this->filename);
    }
}

// Add PruneCommand to your schedule (app/Console/Kernel.php)
$schedule->command(PruneCommand::class)->daily();
```

### withAggregate method
Under the hood, the withAvg/withCount/withSum and other methods in Eloquent use the 'withAggregate' method. You can use this method to add a subselect based on a relationship

```php
// Eloquent Model
class Post extends Model
{
    public function user()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }
}

// Instead of eager loading all users...
$posts = Post::with('user')->get();

// You can add a subselect to only retrieve the user's name...
$posts = Post::withAggregate('user', 'name')->get();

// This will add a 'user_name' attribute to the Post instance:
$posts->first()->user_name;
```

### Date convention
Using the `something_at` convention instead of just a boolean in Laravel models gives you visibility into when a flag was changed – like when a product went live.

```php
// Migration
Schema::table('products', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->datetime('live_at')->nullable();
});

// In your model
public function live()
{
    return !is_null($this->live_at);
}

// Also in your model
protected $dates = [
    'live_at'
];
```

### Eloquent multiple upserts
The upsert() method will insert or update multiple records.

- First array: the values to insert or update
- Second: unique identifier columns used in the select statement
- Third: columns that you want to update if the record exists

```php
Flight::upsert([
    ['departure' => 'Oakland', 'destination' => 'San Diego', 'price' => 99],
    ['departure' => 'Chicago', 'destination' => 'New York', 'price' => 150],
], ['departure', 'destination'], ['price']);
```

### Retrieve the Query Builder after filtering the results
To retrieve the Query Builder after filtering the results: you can use `->toQuery()`.<br>
The method internally use the first model of the collection and a `whereKey` comparison on the Collection models.
```php
// Retrieve all logged_in users
$loggedInUsers = User::where('logged_in', true)->get();

// Filter them using a Collection method or php filtering
$nthUsers = $loggedInUsers->nth(3);

// You can't do this on the collection
$nthUsers->update(/* ... */);

// But you can retrieve the Builder using ->toQuery()
if ($nthUsers->isNotEmpty()) {
    $nthUsers->toQuery()->update(/* ... */);
}
```

### Custom casts
You can create custom casts to have Laravel automatically format your Eloquent model data. Here's an example that capitalises a user's name when it is retrieved or changed.
```php
class CapitalizeWordsCast implements CastsAttributes
{
    public function get($model, string $key, $value, array $attributes)
    {
        return ucwords($value);
    }
    
    public function set($model, string $key, $value, array $attributes)
    {
        return ucwords($value);
    }
}

class User extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'name'  => CapitalizeWordsCast::class,
        'email' => 'string',
    ]; 
}
```

Did you ever need to order based on a related model's average or count?<br>
It's easy with Eloquent!
```php

    Book::query()
        ->withAvg('ratings as average_rating', 'rating')
        ->orderByDesc('average_rating');
}
```

### Return transactions result
If you have a DB transaction and want to return its result, there are at least two ways, see the example
```php
// 1. You can pass the parameter by reference
$invoice = NULL;
DB::transaction(function () use (&$invoice) {
    $invoice = Invoice::create(...);
    $invoice->items()->attach(...);
})

// 2. Or shorter: just return trasaction result
$invoice = DB::transaction(function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::create(...);
    $invoice->items()->attach(...);
    
    return $invoice;
});
```

### Remove several global scopes from query
When using Eloquent Global Scopes, you not only can use MULTIPLE scopes, but also remove certain scopes when you don't need them, by providing the array to `withoutGlobalScopes()`<br>
[Link to docs](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent#removing-global-scopes)

```php
// Remove all of the global scopes...
User::withoutGlobalScopes()->get();

// Remove some of the global scopes...
User::withoutGlobalScopes([
    FirstScope::class, SecondScope::class
])->get();
```

### Order JSON column attribute
With Eloquent you can order results by a JSON column attribute
```php
// JSON column example:
// bikes.settings = {"is_retired": false}
$bikes = Bike::where('athlete_id', $this->athleteId)
        ->orderBy('name')
        ->orderByDesc('settings->is_retired')
        ->get();
```

### Get single column's value from the first result
You can use `value()` method to get single column's value from the first result of a query

```php
// Instead of
Integration::where('name', 'foo')->first()->active;

// You can use
Integration::where('name', 'foo')->value('active');

// or this to throw an exception if no records found
Integration::where('name', 'foo')->valueOrFail('active')';
```

### Check if altered value changed key
Ever wanted to know if the changes you've made to a model have altered the value for a  key? No problem, simply reach for originalIsEquivalent.

```php
$user = User::first(); // ['name' => "John']

$user->name = 'John';

$user->originalIsEquivalent('name'); // true

$user->name = 'David'; // Set directly
$user->fill(['name' => 'David']); // Or set via fill

$user->originalIsEquivalent('name'); // false
```

### New way to define accessor and mutator

New way to define attribute accessors and mutators in Laravel 8.77:

```php
// Before, two-method approach
public function setTitleAttribute($value)
{
    $this->attributes['title'] = strtolower($value);
}
public function getTitleAttribute($value)
{
    return strtoupper($value);
}
 
// New approach
protected function title(): Attribute
{
    return new Attribute(
        get: fn ($value) => strtoupper($value),
        set: fn ($value) => strtolower($value),
}
```

Tip given by [@Teacoders](https://twitter.com/Teacoders/status/1473697808456851466)

### Another way to do accessors and mutators

In case you are going to use the same accessors and mutators in many models , You can use custom casts instead.

Just create a `class` that implements `CastsAttributes` interface. The class should have two methods, the first is `get` to specify how models should be retrieved from the database and the second is `set` to specify how the the value will be stored in the database.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Casts;

use Carbon\Carbon;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Database\Eloquent\CastsAttributes;

class TimestampsCast implements CastsAttributes
{
    public function get($model, string $key, $value, array $attributes)
    {
        return Carbon::parse($value)->diffForHumans();
    }

    public function set($model, string $key, $value, array $attributes)
    {
        return Carbon::parse($value)->format('Y-m-d h:i:s');
    }
}

```

Then you can implement the cast in the model class.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use App\Casts\TimestampsCast;
use Carbon\Carbon;


class User extends Authenticatable
{

    /**
     * The attributes that should be cast.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $casts = [
        'updated_at' => TimestampsCast::class,
        'created_at' => TimestampsCast::class,
    ];
}

```

### When searching for the first record, you can perform some actions
When searching for the first record, you want to perform some actions, when you don't find it. `firstOrFail()` throws a 404 Exception. <br>
You can use `firstOr(function() {})` instead. Laravel got your covered
```php
$book = Book::whereCount('authors')
            ->orderBy('authors_count', 'DESC')
            ->having('modules_count', '>', 10)
            ->firstOr(function() {
                // THe Sky is the Limit ...
                
                // You can perform any action here
            });
```

### Directly convert created_at date to human readable format
Did you know you can directly convert created_at date to human readble format like 1 miniute ago, 1 month ago using diffForHumans() function. Laravel eloquent by default enables Carbon instance on created_at field.
```php
$post = Post::whereId($id)->first();
$result = $post->created_at->diffForHumans();

/* OUTPUT */
// 1 Minutes ago, 2 Week ago etc..as per created time
```

### Ordering by an Eloquent Accessor
Ordering by an Eloquent Accessor! Yes, that's doable. Instead of ordering by the accessor on the DB level, we order by the accessor on the returned Collection.
```php
class User extends Model
{
    // ...
    protected $appends = ['full_name'];
    
    public function getFullNameAttribute()
    {
        return $this->attribute['first_name'] . ' ' . $this->attributes['last_name'];
    }
    // ..
}
```

```php
class UserController extends Controller
{
    // ..
    public function index()
    {
        $users = User::all();
        
        // order by full_name desc
        $users->sortByDesc('full_name');
        
        // or
        
        // order by full_name asc
        $users->sortBy('full_name');
        
        // ..
    }
    // ..
}
```

`sortByDesc` and `sortBy` are methods on the Collection

### Check for specific model was created or found
If you want to check for specific model was created or found, use `wasRecentlyCreated` model attribute.
```php
$user = User::create([
    'name' => 'Oussama',
]);

// return boolean
return $user->wasRecentlyCreated;

// true for recently created
// false for found (already on you db)
```

### Make use of the value method on the query builder
Make use of the `value` method on the query builder to execute a more efficient query when you only need to retrieve a single column.
```php
// Before (fetches all columns on the row)
Statistic::where('user_id', 4)->first()->post_count;

// After (fetches only `post_count`)
Statistic::where('user_id', 4)->value('post_count');
```

### Pass array to where method
Laravel you can pass an array to the where method.
```php
// Instead of this
JobPost::where('company', 'laravel')
        ->where('job_type', 'full time')
        ->get();

// You can pass an array
JobPost::where(['company' => 'laravel',
                'job_type' => 'full time'])
        ->get();
```

### Return the primary keys from models collection
Did you know `modelsKeys()` eloquent collection method? It returns the primary keys from models collection.
```php
$users = User::active()->limit(3)->get();

$users->modelsKeys(); // [1, 2, 3]
```

### Force Laravel to use eager loading

If you want to prevent a lazy loading in your app, you only need to add following line to the `boot()` method in your `AppServiceProvider`

```php
Model::preventLazyLoading();
```
But, if you want to enable this feature only on your local development you can change above code on that:
```php
Model::preventLazyLoading(!app()->isProduction());
```

### Make all your models mass assignable

It is not a recommended approach for security reasons, but it is possible.

When you want do this, you don't need to set an empty `$guarded` array for every model, like this:

```php
protected $guarded = [];
```

You can do it from a single place, just add following line to the `boot()` method in your `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
Model::unguard();
```

Now, all your models are mass assignable.

### Hiding columns in select all statements

If you use Laravel v8.78 and MySQL 8.0.23 and onwards, you can define choosen columns as "invisible". Columns which are define as `invisible` will be hidden from the `select *` statements.

However, to do so, we must use a `invisible()` method in the migration, something like that:
```php
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

Schema::table('table', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('secret')->nullable()->invisible();
});
```

That's it! This will make chosen column hidden from `select *` statement.

### JSON Where Clauses
Laravel offers helpers to query JSON columns for databases that support them. <br>

Currently, MySQL 5.7+, PostgreSQL, SQL Server 2016, and SQLite 3.9.0 (using the JSON1 extension)

```php
// To query a json column you can use the -> operator
$users = User::query()
            ->where('preferences->dining->meal', 'salad')
            ->get();
// You can check if a JSON array contains a set of values
$users = User::query()
            ->whereJsonContains('options->languages', [
                'en', 'de'
               ])
            ->get();
// You can also query by the length a JSON array
$users = User::query()
            ->whereJsonLength('options->languages', '>', 1)
            ->get();
```

### Get all the table names in database
```php
$tables = DB::select('SHOW TABLES');

$tableName = "Tables_in_" . DB::getDatabaseName();

foreach ($tables as $table) {
     Log::info($table->$tableName);
}
```

### Get all the column names for a table
```php
DB::getSchemaBuilder()->getColumnListing('users');
/*
returns [
    'id',
    'name',
    'email',
    'email_verified_at',
    'password',
    'remember_token',
    'created_at',
    'updated_at',
]; 
*/
```

### Compare the values of two columns
You can use `whereColumn` method to compare the values of two columns.

```php
return Task::whereColumn('created_at', 'updated_at')->get();
// pass a comparison operator
return Task::whereColumn('created_at', '>', 'updated_at')->get();
```

### Accessor Caching
As of Laravel 9.6, if you have a computationally intensive accessor, you can use the shouldCache method.

```php
public function hash(): Attribute
{
    return Attribute::make(
        get: fn($value) => bcrypt(gzuncompress($value)),
    )->shouldCache();
}
```

### New scalar() method
In Laravel 9.8.0, the `scalar()` method was added that allows you to retrieve the first column of the first row from the query result.

```php
// Before
DB::selectOne("SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN food = 'burger' THEN 1 END) AS burgers FROM menu_items;")->burgers
// Now
DB::scalar("SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN food = 'burger' THEN 1 END) FROM menu_items;")
```

### Select specific columns
To select specific columns on a model you can use the select method -- or you can pass an array directly to the get method!

```php
// Select specified columns from all employees
$employees = Employee::select(['name', 'title', 'email'])->get();
// Select specified columns from all employees
$employees = Employee::get(['name', 'title', 'email']);
```

### Chain conditional clauses to the query without writing if-else statements
The "when" helper in the query builder is🔥

You can chain conditional clauses to the query without writing if-else statements.

Makes your query very clear:

```php
class RatingSorter extends Sorter
{
    function execute(Builder $query)
    {
        $query
            ->selectRaw('AVG(product_ratings.rating) AS avg_rating')
            ->join('product_ratings', 'products.id', '=', 'product_ratings.product_id')
            ->groupBy('products.id');
            ->when(
                $this->direction === SortDirections::Desc,
                fn () => $query->orderByDesc('avg_rating')
                fn () => $query->orderBy('avg_rating'),
            );
        
        return $query;
    }
}
```
