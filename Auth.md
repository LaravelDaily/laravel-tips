### Check Multiple Permissions at Once

In addition to `@can` Blade directive, did you know you can check multiple permissions at once with `@canany` directive?

```blade
@canany(['update', 'view', 'delete'], $post)
    // The current user can update, view, or delete the post
@elsecanany(['create'], \App\Post::class)
    // The current user can create a post
@endcanany
```

### More Events on User Registration

Want to perform some actions after new user registration? Head to `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php` and add more Listeners classes, and then in those classes implement `handle()` method with `$event->user` object

```php
class EventServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    protected $listen = [
        Registered::class => [
            SendEmailVerificationNotification::class,

            // You can add any Listener class here
            // With handle() method inside of that class
        ],
    ];
```

### Did you know about Auth::once()?

You can login with user only for ONE REQUEST, using method `Auth::once()`.  
No sessions or cookies will be utilized, which means this method may be helpful when building a stateless API.

```php
if (Auth::once($credentials)) {
    //
}
```

### Change API Token on users password update

It's convenient to change the user's API Token when its password changes.

Model:

```php
protected function password(): Attribute
{
    return Attribute::make(
            set: function ($value, $attributes) {
                $value = $value;
                $attributes['api_token'] = Str::random(100);
            }
        );
}
```

### Override Permissions for Super Admin

If you've defined your Gates but want to override all permissions for SUPER ADMIN user, to give that superadmin ALL permissions, you can intercept gates with `Gate::before()` statement, in `AuthServiceProvider.php` file.

```php
// Intercept any Gate and check if it's super admin
Gate::before(function($user, $ability) {
    if ($user->is_super_admin == 1) {
        return true;
    }
});

// Or if you use some permissions package...
Gate::before(function($user, $ability) {
    if ($user->hasPermission('root')) {
        return true;
    }
});
```
