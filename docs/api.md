## API Resources: With or Without "data"?

If you use Eloquent API Resources to return data, they will be automatically wrapped in 'data'. If you want to remove it, add `JsonResource::withoutWrapping();` in `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`.

```php
class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        JsonResource::withoutWrapping();
    }
}
```

## API Return "Everything went ok"

If you have API endpoint which performs some operations but has no response, so you wanna return just "everything went ok", you may return 204 status code "No
content". In Laravel, it's easy: `return response()->noContent();`.

```php
public function reorder(Request $request)
{
    foreach ($request->input('rows', []) as $row) {
        Country::find($row['id'])->update(['position' => $row['position']]);
    }

    return response()->noContent();
}
```

## Avoid N+1 queries in API resources

You can avoid N+1 queries in API resources by using the `whenLoaded()` method.<br>
This will only append the department if itâ€™s already loaded in the Employee model.<br>
Without `whenLoaded()` there is always a query for the department

```php
class EmplyeeResource extends JsonResource
{
    public function toArray($request): array
    {
        return [
            'id' => $this->uuid,
            'fullName' => $this->full_name,
            'email' => $this->email,
            'jobTitle' => $this->job_title,
            'department' => DepartmentResource::make($this->whenLoaded('department')),
        ];
    }
}
```
