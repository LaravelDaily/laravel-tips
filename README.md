# IMPORTANT: March 2022

It's horrible to see what is happening now in Ukraine, as Russian army is [bombarding houses, hospitals and kindergartens](https://twitter.com/DavidCornDC/status/1501620037785997316). 

Please [check out supportukrainenow.org](https://supportukrainenow.org/) for the ways how you can help people there. Spread the word.

And if you are from Russia and you are against this war, please express your protest in some way. I know you can get punished for this, but you are one of the hopes of those innocent people.
